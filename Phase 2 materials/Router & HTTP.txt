Angular Routing
Routing ==> move from one part of the application to another part or one View to another View ==> Angular Router Module.

Angular Router
Router ==> separate module in Angular ==> @angular/router. Angular Router ==> necessary service providers and directives for navigating through application views.

Navigate to a specific view ==> URL 
Pass optional query parameters 
Bind the elements to the View and load the view when the user performs application tasks

Components of Angular Router
1. Router
Angular Router ==> service (API) ==> enables navigation from one component to the next component ==> users tasks ==> clicking menu, links, button, back/forward button ==> navigate() or navigateByUrl()

2. Route
Route ==> Angular Router ==> view to display when a user clicks a link or pastes a URL into the browser address bar. Every Route consists of a path and a component it is mapped to. The Router object parses and builds the final URL using the Route

3. Routes
Routes is an array of Route objects our application supports

4. RouterOutlet
The outerOutlet is a directive (<router-outlet>) that serves as a placeholder, where the Router should display the view

5. RouterLink
The RouterLink is a directive that binds the HTML element to a Route. Clicking on the HTML element, which is bound to a RouterLink, will result in navigation to the Route. The RouterLink may contain parameters to be passed to the routeâ€™s component.

6. RouterLinkActive
RouterLinkActive is a directive for adding or removing classes from an HTML element that is bound to a RouterLink. Using this directive, we can toggle CSS classes for active RouterLinks based on the current RouterState

7. ActivatedRoute
The ActivatedRoute is an object that represents the currently activated route associated with the loaded Component.

8. RouterState
The current state of the router includes a tree of the currently activated routes together with convenience methods for traversing the route tree.

9. RouteLink Parameters array
The Parameters or arguments to the Route. It is an array that you can bind to RouterLink directive or pass it as an argument to the Router.navigate method.
